## 🎯 Module Objective

Before architecting highly scalable APIs or complex cloud microservices, a software engineer must master the primitives. This directory serves as the bedrock of my .NET journey. 

The focus here is entirely on **Algorithmic Thinking** and **Console I/O**. It demonstrates the transition from executing simple linear scripts to building persistent, interactive applications that handle user input safely and efficiently.
