# C# Practice Projects & Utilities

This repository contains a collection of C# applications and utilities
developed to practice writing clean, maintainable, and well-structured code.

The projects focus on real-world scenarios and cover a wide range of C#
features, from core language fundamentals to advanced topics such as
asynchronous programming, performance optimization, and unit testing.

## Projects Overview

- Console-based utilities (calculators, data processors, parsers)
- Object-oriented applications with clear separation of concerns
- Data processing tools (CSV, JSON, API-based data)
- Custom implementations of core data structures
- Desktop application using Windows Forms
- Asynchronous and multi-threaded applications
- Test-driven and testable components

## Selected Implementations

- Calculator and task management utilities
- Dice-based game with extensible design
- Recipe composition and persistence system
- Robust data parsing with advanced exception handling
- Generic in-memory caching mechanism
- Performance-optimized CSV processing
- API-driven statistics analyzer
- Custom linked list with full IEnumerable support
- Text and document data aggregation tools
- Numeric analysis desktop application
- Unit-tested algorithmic components
- Clean-code focused refactoring exercises
- Asynchronous quote fetching and processing tool

## Technical Focus

- Object-Oriented Design & SOLID principles
- Clean Code and refactoring techniques
- Exception handling strategies
- Generics, LINQ, and functional-style constructs
- Memory management and performance considerations
- Unit testing with NUnit and mocking
- Asynchronous programming and multithreading

This repository reflects a continuous effort to improve code quality,
design decisions, and practical problem-solving in C#.
