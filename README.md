Welcome to my comprehensive C# learning repository. This is not just a collection of scripts; it is a structured documentation of my journey mastering **.NET**, **Software Architecture**, and **Clean Code principles**.

Here, I dissect complex topics, build robust utilities, and implement real-world design patterns.
